The Audi sleep Fix
Copy and paste this entire block into your terminal. It will create the folders and the configuration file in one go:

Bash

mkdir -p ~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/ && cat <<EOF > ~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/51-disable-suspension.conf
monitor.alsa.rules = [
  {
    matches = [
      {
        node.name = "~alsa_input.usb-Anker.*"
      },
      {
        node.name = "~alsa_output.usb-Anker.*"
      }
    ]
    actions = {
      update-props = {
        session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0
      }
    }
  }
]
EOF
After running that, apply the changes:
For PipeWire to "see" this new rule and stop the Anker from sleeping, you need to restart the media services:

Bash

systemctl --user restart wireplumber pipewire pipewire-pulse
How to verify it worked:
Run this command to see if WirePlumber has loaded your new config file:

Bash

wpctl status
If everything is correct, your Anker device should now stay in an "IDLE" or "RUNNING" state in the wpctl list, but it will never switch to "SUSPENDED."
